All the weaker bombs have been slightly reworked into more powerful, more useful version of themselves which can add some flavor to a playthough.
# Full Change List:

## Acid Flask
- now affects a 7 tile area ( similar to the Fire Bomb )

## Holy Water
- now affects a 7 tile area (similar to the Fire Bomb)
- use the Crafting Expansion submod in order to be able to craft more of these.

## Fire Bomb
- the burn application effect of the Fire Bomb now applies 1 negative morale check to the target. ( applies to the player's bros also - don't stand in the fire!)
- this means that a target that takes all 3 fire application ticks of the firebomb, could potentially rout from the fire effect.

## New Item: Poison Bomb
- applies Goblin Poison Effect on a 7 tile radius.
- craftable using 2x Goblin Poison Items (could someone please create an icon for me for this one?)
- also works with Slings

## New Item: Frost Bomb
- applies the Chilled Effect on a 7 tile Radius (-2ap, -30 initiative)
- creates Snow Ground on the tiles affected lowering the movement through the area.
- can be crafted from a Frost Unhold Fur and Serpent Skin

## New Perk: Grenadier
- Found in Throwing Perk Tree at Tier 7.
- Effects
---- Increases the Range of Bomb Throwing by 1 (works with Slings also)
---- Reduces the Fatigue Cost of Throwing a Bomb by 25%
---- Gives a 57% chance of not wasting the bomb you just thrown, enabling it to be thrown again.
